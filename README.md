<h3> Target Localization and Tracking in 3D </h3>

Research and simulation codes for implementing a PSO based target tracking algorithm. 

Based on principles of Fischer Information, PSO, RSSI, Estimation theory.

Currently localizing on Paths in 3D. Placing the sensors on a realistic surface.

Project Wiki to be updated soon.
